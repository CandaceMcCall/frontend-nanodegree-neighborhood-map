Project 5 Neighborhood Map

I chose to show the restaurants in the neighborhood of my office.   I use
FourSquare to get a list of restaurants within 3 miles.  I save this information
in a data model to be used later.   

To start the application, open the file index.html with your favorite
browser.   A list of restaurants will show.   Enter in the search box a
string to narrow your choices.  You can click on a restaurant to see
more info on a restaurant or click on a map marker.   Within the popup
window, you will see a link to the restaurant website and a link to
the menu for the restaurant.
